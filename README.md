# Questions
- What choices did you make when implementing your library?
  - Chose to implement a functioning Deck that can:
     - Be Initialized with 52 cards
     - Be Shuffled
     - Be Displayed
     - Cards are able to be compared based on their ranking and suit
- What trade-offs did you consider?
  - Prioritized a good foundation over broken functionality
      - Such as creating decks with the correct amount of cards, suits, and rankings  
- How would you extend your library to address a new requirement?
  - For each new requirement, a new function would need to be added to satsify the requirement. Since there is already a solid foundation, a simple class is just needed to address new requirements.
